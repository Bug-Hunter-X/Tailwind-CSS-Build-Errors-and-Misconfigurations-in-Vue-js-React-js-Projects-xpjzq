The solution typically involves verifying the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`), ensuring it correctly points to your project's CSS files and includes necessary plugins. Also, double-check that the `@tailwind` directives (e.g., `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`) are correctly placed within your main CSS file (usually `main.css` or `globals.css`) and that it's correctly imported or included in your project. For example, you might need to adjust paths, add missing plugins, or correctly configure the PostCSS setup.  Always review the official Tailwind CSS documentation and follow its instructions carefully for integrating it with your specific JavaScript framework.
