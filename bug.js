This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Vue.js or React.js that uses a build process. The error message often indicates that Tailwind CSS cannot find or process the necessary configuration files or directives within your project structure.  This can manifest as missing styles, unexpected behavior, or build errors. For example, a common error message might be `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/jit` or variations thereof, indicating a problem in the Tailwind setup or integration with the build system.  Another scenario might involve incorrect usage of `@tailwind directives` leading to processing issues.
