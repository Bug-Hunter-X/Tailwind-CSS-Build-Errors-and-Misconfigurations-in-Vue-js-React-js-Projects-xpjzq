# Tailwind CSS Build Errors and Misconfigurations
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when integrating Tailwind CSS into Vue.js or React.js projects.  The problem centers on build errors and unexpected styling behavior stemming from incorrect configuration or setup within the build process.

The `bug.js` file showcases a project with a typical misconfiguration, leading to build errors or rendering issues. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version illustrating proper Tailwind integration.

**Key Issues Addressed:**
* Incorrect pathing to Tailwind config files.
* Missing or improperly placed `@tailwind` directives.
* Integration problems with module bundlers (Webpack, Vite, etc.).
